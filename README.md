# scratch-supporterlist
Automated listing of a suggestion's supporters and nonsupporters.

You know, I wasn't one to heavily favor the simple replies of "support" and "no support" on [https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/1/](Scratch's Suggestion forums) but then I thought, maybe I could take advantage of this. Instead of cumbersomely flipping through pages and counting, listing, and organizing all the supporters and nonsupporters, I could let a computer do all this for me.

Sure enough, this program was designed to do exactly that. I'm not trying to make the most pretty webpage for it because I want the focus to be on the application's usefulness. I hope this serves a great deal of satisfaction by saving you a lot of time.

My program isn't perfect, I'm certain, and any help is greatly appreciated. I would be pleased to hear how accurate my program worked for you, and any suggestions you have to offer.
